# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up UI for Scrabble app

**Thoughts**: I am moderately confident with CSS grid and flexbox. I know how to set up the basics with React but am eager for practice on more nuanced elements to make the app interactive/complex.

### Day 17: Wednesday, January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added mobile menu and shopping cart for non-prophet e-commerce site. Completed FCC request header parser project.

**Thoughts**: Even a relatively simple e-commerce app can be quite complex. Dealing with edge cases of user interaction takes time. I think I need to re-factor my functions to create more concise code and to adhere to DRY.

### Day 18: Thursday, January 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC URL Shortener project. Started on FCC Exercise tracker project. Went through CSX JavaScript modules.

**Thoughts**: I need a lot more practice with the back-end â€“ e.g. using Express, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, etc. FCC projects have been helpful to start to understand HTTP request/response cycle better. CSX is serving as review and solidifying my foundational understanding of JavaScript. Helpful to see the big picture to become better at debugging, structuring, practicing DRY.

### Day 20: Saturday, January 23, 2021

### Day 21: Sunday, January 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about closure on CSX. Set up non-prophet server.js file 

**Thoughts**: CSX broke down closure very clearly. Challenges gave me a chance to practice what I know. Pseudocode and going over what is happening line by line is good practice for technical communication
