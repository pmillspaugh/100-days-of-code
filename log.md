# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up UI for Scrabble app

**Thoughts**: I am moderately confident with CSS grid and flexbox. I know how to set up the basics with React but am eager for practice on more nuanced elements to make the app interactive/complex.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp JavaScript calculator using React

**Thoughts**: Practiced lifting state up in React to pass information between components. Code is a bit messy - could refactor to implement more elegant solutions where possible.
