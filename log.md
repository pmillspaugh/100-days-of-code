# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up UI for Scrabble app

**Thoughts**: I am moderately confident with CSS grid and flexbox. I know how to set up the basics with React but am eager for practice on more nuanced elements to make the app interactive/complex.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp JavaScript calculator using React

**Thoughts**: Practiced lifting state up in React to pass information between components. Code is a bit messy - could refactor to implement more elegant solutions where possible.

### Day 3: Wednesday, January 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp 25 + 5 Clock using React

**Thoughts**: Got more comfortable with React hooks, including employing useRef for the first time. Decent grasp of the React basics, so I want to go a layer deeper (e.g. learn more hooks).

**Today's Progress**: Completed freeCodeCamp data visualization with d3 and JSON APIs / AJAX modules, almost finished D3 Bar Chart project
